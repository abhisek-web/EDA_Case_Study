# EDA_Case_Study
This is an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Case Study where the outcome is to figure out the defaulters and to predict the pattern in order to curb bank losses.
The goal of this project is to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this project. 
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
